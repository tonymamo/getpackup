Worst experience in the backcountry:



I’m not going to get into too much detail but it involves rock climbing in Mexico, montezuma's revenge and unwanted bowel movements which led to a very uncomfortable but memorable experience on a wall.



Would you rather camp on a beach or on a mountain?



Both, a beach at a lake in the alpine. Does that count?



What is one thing you learned about yourself recently?



During the lockdown I have learned how to be more vulnerable and open up more. I have also learned that I can not sit still, I need to constantly be doing something which ultimately led to creating packup with Mack and Tony!



If you could camp anywhere in the world next weekend where would you go?



Socotra Island, Yemen. It’s like something out of a Dr. Seuss book. Seriously, Google it.



What are your favourite outdoor activities?



Backpacking, Biking, Backcountry skiing, Climbing, Running (love/hate), Hiking, Paddling



What is one item that you couldn't live without?



Water, literally I guess. I am a water-aholic.



Share about a time when you felt the most alive and fully yourself?



Backpacking through New Zealand in 2011, that’s where I first got into the outdoors and my life changed drastically. I spent a lot of time in the bush avoiding cities and civilization, only going in town for food when I needed to restock supplies. Still chasing that feeling of freedom and discovery.



What injustices in the world make you angry?



Inequality, across the board.



Is a hot dog a sandwich, and why?



Anything between two pieces of bread qualifies as a sandwich in my eyes.



What is your biggest dream in life?



To be successful enough to easily and consistently spend time outdoors and travel, also to be in a position where I can give back to my community more in meaningful ways.



What motivates you to work hard?



Seeing others succeeding, it helps to push me further. That and passion, when I am passionate about something nothing can stop me from constantly working hard at it.



Was the outdoor lifestyle something that you grew up in or was it discovered?



I grew up in a very urban environment, my parents enjoy being outside but we never did a ton of family camping trips or anything like that. I made the transition from “city boy” to “granola” after high school when I did some travelling. I made new friends who introduced me to that lifestyle and I couldn't believe it took me that long to fully “discover” it.
