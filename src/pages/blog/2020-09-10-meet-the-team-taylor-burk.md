**Worst experience in the backcountry?**

I’m not going to get into too much detail, I'll let your imagination wander but it involves rock climbing in Mexico, montezuma's revenge and sudden bowel movements which led to a very uncomfortable but memorable experience on a wall. If you're entertained by poo stories I'd be more than happy to share the full story with you!

**Would you rather camp on a beach or on a mountain?**

Does a beach at an alpine lake count?

**What is one thing you learned about yourself recently?**

During the lockdown I have learned how to be more vulnerable and open up more. I have also learned that I can not sit still, I need to constantly be doing something which ultimately led to creating packup with Mack and Tony!

**If you could camp anywhere in the world next weekend where would you go?**

Socotra Island, Yemen. It’s like something out of a Dr. Seuss book. Seriously, Google it. I've never seen anything like it before and would love to visit.

**What are your favourite outdoor activities?**

Backpacking, Biking, Backcountry skiing, Climbing, Running (love/hate), Hiking, Paddling. Pretty much anything that keeps me active and provides a challenge.

**What is one item that you couldn't live without?**

Hats. Big hat guy, I never used to be but now I don't go anywhere or do anything without one. Definitely has nothing to do with my hair thinning out.

**Share about a time when you felt the most alive and fully yourself?**

Backpacking through New Zealand in 2011, that’s where I first got into the outdoors and my life changed drastically. I spent a lot of time in the backcountry learning about myself without any distractions, avoiding cities and civilization, only going in town for food when I needed to restock supplies. Still chasing that feeling of simple living, freedom and discovery.

**What injustices in the world make you angry?**

Inequality, across the board. Why can't we all just get along?

**Is a hot dog a sandwich, and why?**

It could be a cousin of the sandwich for sure, it's in the same family group. Same, same but different.

**What is your biggest dream in life?**

To be successful enough to easily and consistently spend quality time outdoors and with the people that I love the most, also to be in a position where I can give back to my community in more meaningful ways.

**What motivates you to work hard?**

I am the most driven when it comes to creating or building things that I am passionate about. Anything that will make life better for the people around me and myself.

**Was the outdoor lifestyle something that you grew up in or was it discovered?**

I grew up in a very urban environment, my parents enjoy being outside but we never did a ton of family camping trips or anything like that. I made the transition from “city boy” to “granola” after high school when I did some travelling. I made new friends who introduced me to that lifestyle and I couldn't believe it took me that long to fully “discover” it.
