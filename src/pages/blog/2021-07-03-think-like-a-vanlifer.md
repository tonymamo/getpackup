You probably ended up here because you’re intrigued about the idea of living in a van. The 9-5 office job or working from home just isn’t cutting it for you and you’re craving something new and exciting. You scroll past Instagram posts with the hashtag #vanlife and you feel a little jealous, a little lustful and a little curious. Some days you think, I could totally do that, but other days you're not sure if you're brave enough for it. Curiosity is what counts!

When I decided to quit my job and move across the world to Australia to live in a van, I was more of the, I could totally do that type. I actually kept my #vanlife plans a secret to avoid hearing other people’s criticisms and discouragements, especially since I am a woman and planned to do it solo. After taking some time to overcome the jet lag and initial shock of being alone in a new country I eventually bought my first van. It was only after making an introductory instagram post that my loved ones found out I was living in a van AKA my least expensive home. No regrets. 

Not everyone needs to have sheer determination to live in a van. It’s okay to stay up tossing and turning attempting to decide whether it’s for you or not. It’s also okay and recommended to consult your best buds to see what they think. An important part of living in a van, besides having enough money to buy it and a strong desire to be free, includes having the right mindset and personality to do it.

##### Here are 6 ways to know that you think like a vanlifer: 

<br />

##### **1. You like to take risks**

<br />

Living in a van can be considered risky. Most of the time you’ll find yourself on adventures and ask yourself 'how did I even get here?' — I had my fair share of those moments, especially when I took my non-4WD van on 4WD only roads. You take a risk by doing something a little different than most people do. In doing so however, you risk injury, van problems, theft, getting lost and possibly financial insecurity. Thankfully, with growing popularity, there are tons of resources on the internet that can help set you up for success. You can even buy security systems for mobile homes now. Most of all, being aware of risks and preparing accordingly will help you succeed in the long run.

##### **2. You’re okay with a little mess**

<br />

I saw this photo while walking the artsy streets of Fremantle, Western Australia and found it completely accurate. Instagram shows you beautiful van interiors that are clean and staged for the perfect photo that will bring the most likes. Truth is, when you move all your belongings into a 100 sq ft space, things get messy pretty quickly. A mess can occur in the blink of an eye and sometimes you just have to roll with it. Although for the sake of your mental wellness, I’d recommend not living in a constant pigsty!

<br />

##### **3. You don’t expect everything to go right**

<br />

Living on the road in unfamiliar places is a breeding ground for trouble to ensue. Most of the time, things won’t happen as you planned. You might end up with car troubles in the middle of nowhere, you might run out of gas with the next gas station being 250km away or you make a wrong turn and get totally lost. The best you can do for yourself is to be prepared for the worst outcomes and avoid expecting things to go a certain way. The ability to find humour in difficult situations will help you keep your stress levels low. If you’re well prepared before your big trip, anything can happen and hopefully you’ll be able to figure out a solution.

##### **4. You love to travel**

<br />

To me, this is the best part of living in a van! To have my “home” and all of my belongings with me on my travels was a big plus, especially since I’m prone to forgetting important items behind. Living in a van in Australia meant I could land in Brisbane, drive 25,000km around the country and thanks to the high demand, sell my van in Perth right before I flew home. Along the way I met incredible people who would serve as my guides and lead me in the right direction for the rest of my trip. My itinerary was based on other people’s suggestions and it proved to be an amazing way to travel as I experienced local spots that were off the beaten track. 

<br />

##### **5. You love to learn**

<br />

Chances are, unless you know everything about minimalism, travel, cars, and interior decorating, you can expect to learn things while you’re on the road in your van. I had very minimal experience with cars and building but I jumped on every opportunity to learn. I learned how to turn the solar panel on the rooftop into usable electricity, how to check my oil and other fluids while on long trips and even how to break into my car when I locked myself out multiple times. I spoke to staff at the local building stores and they taught me what hardware or tools I needed for certain DIY projects such as a folding table or my rooftop patio. When I came across other people living in vans, they were often happy to share their knowledge if you showed some interest. If you love to learn, living in a van will provide many opportunities for you to gain practical skills. 

<br />

##### **6. You don’t place much value on “stuff”**

<br />

Moving your apartment in the city to a 100 square foot van will likely require you to get rid of extra things that you don’t really need. You know, the things that don’t “bring you joy”, as Marie Condo would say. You can’t go on shopping sprees when you live in a van and you can’t bring every book in your library with you either. If you’re lucky you’ll have a place to store your extra stuff that you leave behind for if/when you eventually return to a “normal” life. Otherwise, reducing your belongings to items that you love and will use frequently, is an exercise and adventure in itself.
