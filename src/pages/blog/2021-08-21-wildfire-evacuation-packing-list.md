Here’s a quick checklist to help ensure that you're taking everything important and necessary with you in case of an emergency. In some situations you will have time to prepare and not be rushed but other times may be immediate, it's best to be prepared for anything. Have an emergency plan made that everyone in your household knows and understands what to do if you need to quickly evacuate.

## Plan Ahead

In the event that you have hours or days before your home is at risk, take the time to prepare now in case you have to leave quickly later:

* Coordinate and communicate plans with family and neighbors
* Prepare and pack food, water, leash, and any other pet supplies
* Take inventory of entire home (take pictures of each room and around exterior)
* Pack last minute items you may want (heir- looms, photo albums, computers, etc.)
* Know your local radio stations
* Keep car filled with gas or charged
* Park facing outwards, keys in ignition
* Have Go Bag (below) already in car
* Know your potential driving routes
* Connect garden hoses to faucets and set nozzles to spray position
* Leave a ladder leaned against the house
* If possible, cover exterior openings with plywood
* Fill extra trash cans and buckets with water and leave around property where easily found


## Pack a Go Bag

If you live in a high risk location, having a bag that is already packed and ready to go can be handy. Here are some suggested items:

* 1 Litre/32 ounces of water for each person
* High energy snacks / non-perishable food
* Flashlight/headlamp with spare batteries
* Map with highlighted route options
* Important Documents (Passport, ID, Insurance)
* Emergency Blanket
* Portable Radio (charged) & batteries
* Sturdy shoes & socks
* Emergency Whistle
* Change of clothing (cotton/wool are best)
* Bandana/Mask/Respirator & Gloves
* Wallet, Keys, Cash & Credit Card(s)
* Phone & Charger
* First Aid Kit
* Prescription Meds & Glasses/Contacts
* Face masks or coverings

## If You Have Time
Do the following if you have a minute or two to spare before leaving your house:

* Shut all doors, raise all shades, turn on all lights inside and out, turn off A/C and fans, close attic vents
* Move furniture away from walls
* Close garage door, but leave unlocked
* Turn off gas or propane utilities
* Grab pets, carriers, and pet food
* Grab extra prescriptions/medical devices
* Check on neighbors & offer help if possible
* Put on boots and wool or cotton clothes

If you have any specialty items such as baby or pet needs, be sure to grab those as well!

## Know Important Numbers & Info

It's highly suggested to already have multiple meeting places for you and your family/neighbors should you get separated, but it's also wise to know various contact information should you need to utilize any services or get help. For example, know the local radio stations to be able to hear weather and fire updates, phone numbers for your local Police/Fire/Medical services, and policy information for your home and car.

Be prepared! It will likely be dark, smoky, windy, and hot. There may be airborne burning embers, no power or telephone, and poor water pressure. Remember, there is nothing you own worth your life!

For more information, be sure to watch out for local fire alerts and recommendations from fire departments.
