## Introduction

Hello and welcome to our packup beta! It’s been a long 15 months since we initiated the idea for a packing platform for outdoor adventure. We’ve been through dozens of prototypes, a full alpha testing period, and have received the help and feedback of hundreds of thoughtful and die-hard outdoor users, some of whom have been with us right from our first landing page. We wouldn’t be here today without your interest and support, and it's invigorating to see how many of you share our love of getting outside, and how many stories we’ve heard along the way about people forgetting things on their own adventures.

In this post, we will summarize what to expect from our current beta version, how to get the most out of it, what’s next for the platform, and how you can get involved. We still have a lot of feedback and learning ahead for us, and the more interest we generate in our early stages, the more resources we can invest into improving things. Tell your trail pals about us if you like what we’re doing!

<br><br/>

## Setting up

1. Visit <https://getpackup.com/> on your mobile browser.
2. Using your phone or tablet, save the webpage to your phone’s home screen as a progressive web app. [A simple guide to doing this can be found here](https://natomasunified.org/kb/add-website-to-mobile-device-home-screen/).
3. Open the app, or your mobile browser, and sign up as a user using email, Google, Facebook, Twitter, or GitHub credentials. Your choice! Your profile can be customized once you’re on the platform.
4. You’re done! Explore the platform on your phone, tablet, or desktop computer. Get packing!

### What is a Progressive Web App?

We’re using a new technology called a “progressive web app” for the early stages of our platform - it combines the best of web and mobile apps. Think of it as a website built using web technologies, but acts and feels like an app. It seems complicated, but it's not.

Why did we develop under this framework? This allows us to build, test, and maintain our platform and code base more quickly on iOS, Android, and desktop, and make changes based on early feedback. Eventually in the future, we will have a dedicated native app for iOS and Android once we feel that we have the right product dialed in. If you’re interested in learning more about PWA’s, [here is a great case study on a recent PWA made by Starbucks.](https://formidable.com/work/starbucks-progressive-web-app/)

Keep in mind, if you don’t want to install the PWA, that is perfectly fine - our platform will work well in your mobile browser too, but you’re missing out!

### Current Beta Features

**Trip Generator**

Quickly generate detailed packing lists for your trips by using our **Trip Generator**. Simply select the tagged options such as activities, accommodation type, kitchen requirements, and tons of other considerations when creating your trip to have the foundation of your trip list seeded for you.

**Gear Closet**

When you initially set up your account, we will create a robust **Gear Closet** for you based on your indicated activity interests, which is your *personal* database of tagged items. Dial in your trip preparation further by customizing, adding, deleting, and tagging items in the **Gear Closet** - the Trip Generator will draw items from this database when you go to create a trip. Never forget those personal prescription meds or special considerations again.

**Basic Profile**

Personalize the basics of your account and profile with a picture, banner picture, location, and other items. We're setting the stage for shared trips, lists, and adventures in our future phases.

### How You Can Get Involved

Within the platform there is a megaphone icon in the top right corner that can be used to provide comments which go directly into our #userfeedback slack channel, where we have the chance to summarize and understand your experiences. Any feedback on the topics below is a huge help

1. Bugs and error reporting
2. Potential improvements on existing features
3. New ideas for features
4. Things you dislike, or don’t use
5. Anything else on your mind! Don’t be shy

We will also be conducting user interviews in the next few months for those of you who are interested in diving into more detailed comments. 

### HAPPY PACKING!
