# Introduction

Hello and welcome to our packup beta! It’s been a long 15 months since we initiated the idea for a packing platform for outdoor adventure. We’ve been through dozens of prototypes, a full alpha testing period, and have received the help and feedback of hundreds of thoughtful and die-hard outdoor users, some of whom have been with us right from our first landing page. We wouldn’t be here today without your interest and support, and it's invigorating to see how many of you share our love of getting outside, and how many stories we’ve heard along the way about people forgetting things on their own adventures.

In this post, we will summarize what to expect from our current beta version, how to get the most out of it, what’s next for the platform, and how you can get involved. We still have a lot of feedback and learning ahead for us, and the more interest we generate in our early stages, the more resources we can invest into improving things. Tell your trail pals about us if you like what we’re doing!

# Setting up

1. Visit [getpackup.com](/) on your browser.
2. Find the link to the Apple App Store or Google Play Store to download the app, or, alternatively you can use the web version.
3. Create an account & login.
4. Start packing!



# Current Beta Features

##### **Trip Generator**

Quickly generate detailed packing lists for your trips by using our **Trip Generator**. Simply select the tagged options such as activities, accommodation type, kitchen requirements, and tons of other considerations when creating your trip to have the foundation of your trip list seeded for you.

##### **Gear Closet**

When you initially set up your account, we will create a robust **Gear Closet** for you based on your indicated activity interests, which is your _personal_ database of tagged items. Dial in your trip preparation further by customizing, adding, deleting, and tagging items in the **Gear Closet** - the Trip Generator will draw items from this database when you go to create a trip. Never forget those personal prescription meds or special considerations again.

##### **Basic Profile**

Personalize the basics of your account and profile with a picture, banner picture, location, and other items. We're setting the stage for shared trips, lists, and adventures in our future phases.

### Potential Future Features

#### **Minor Features**

- Custom categorization and tags
- Trip sharing (Leave a plan with loved ones or brag to your friends)
- Weather APIs
- Offline capabilities

#### **Major Features**

- Group trip planning, and shared lists between party members
- Search capabilities for regions or activity type
- Item weight module and total packed weight

The direction we go is entirely based on your feedback, so chime in with what you think is most important to you!

### How You Can Get Involved

Within the platform there is a megaphone icon in the top right corner that can be used to provide comments which go directly into one of our slack channels, where we have the chance to summarize and understand your experiences. Any feedback on the topics below is a huge help:

1. Bugs and error reporting
2. Potential improvements on existing features
3. New ideas for features
4. Things you dislike, or don’t use
5. Anything else on your mind! Don’t be shy


We will also be conducting user interviews in the next few months for those of you who are interested in diving into more detailed comments.

You can send us detailed feedback using our [feedback page](/feedback) or send us a message about anything at [our contact page](/contact).
