Hello there!

We wanted to give you a quick update on how things have been going with the development of our packing app - for anyone who signed up with us previously, we are now known as packup instead of Wapta.

## Discovery

In the last 5 months since our founding, we have been able to gain good traction from our initial marketing campaigns, showing that there is absolutely an interest in improving the packing and preparation process for outdoor excursions. We had close to 1000 email signups in our first 3 days. From these signups, we have interviewed many eager users to discover the real issues that they have when it comes to packing (forgetfulness of items, timeliness of the packing process, collaboration with others), and gleaned other valuable insights into the types of individuals and personalities most excited for this type of solution. Our user base truly comprises people from all geographic regions, demographics, and outdoor experience levels, yet they are similar in their shared values - wanting to get outside and being able to enjoy the outdoors as frequently and effortlessly as possible. Not so different from the team here at packup!

## Prototype Development

Throughout June - August, we have been diving into the prototyping process, beginning initial idea testing with a small cohort of users for feedback. Through customer discovery and prototyping, we have been introduced to a great new team member who brings over a decade of experience in the web and app development space, and who is as much of an outdoors nut as us. Welcome Tony!

## Next Steps

We are going to be moving from the prototyping process to our initial product development (minimum viable product) in the next three months, focusing on a web-based version of Packup that is usable on desktop and mobile browsers to try and accelerate our iteration cycle. From there, we aim to move into creating a native app that can be downloaded to your device, allowing you to sync your account with all platforms. If you have any interest in spending some time testing our initial product and giving us feedback, please get in touch with us [here](/contact).

Very excited to see what we can share with you in the future. Connect with us on our [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/getpackup/) to keep up to date with what weâ€™re working on.

Cheers,

Mack, Taylor, and Tony
