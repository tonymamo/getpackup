# Pre-Trip

- Have you booked your campsite (and saved/printed your registration?)
- Do you have any required passes? (backcountry, park, etc)
- Is your car in good driving shape? Oil and tires are checked? Will you need tire chains?
- Do you need a map to reach your camping area? Do you need to save the map offline?

# Campsite Items

Car camping can entail being in a tent, or sleeping in your car at a site. If you want some ideas on how you can sleep in your car for more protection from the elements, check out our blog post on [building a DIY sleeping platform for your car](blog/2020-11-23-suv-sleeping-platform-a-diy-guide-to-sleeping-inside/). Key campsite items:

- [Tent](https://bit.ly/3qh0P8p)

# Camp Kitchen

The requirements for your camp kitchen will vary depending on the facilities available in proximity to your camp. Be prepared to bring and/or treat water if clean water is not available in your area, and dispose of garbage and greywater waste appropriately following the principles of [LNT (Leave No Trace)](https://www.leavenotrace.ca/).

Minimizing environmental impact and the attraction of wildlife is of utmost importance - many bears who learn to scavenge human camps end up being killed by animal control due to continued negative human interactions! Key items:

- [Camping stove/grill](https://bit.ly/379MJOO)
- Fuel (pack extra, and suitable to stove type)

- Cups/mugs
- Utensils

- Water storage cube (filled!)
- Biodegradable soap w/scrubber
- Trash & recycling bag
- Bear proof storage solutions if none provided at campsite. Hanging bags with rope, bear canisters, or other items to remove food from your sleeping and camp areas.
- Paper towel

**Optional**

- Prep knife
- Cutting board
- Can opener or bottle opener
- Cast iron pan
- Oven mitt
- Aluminum foil
- Roasting sticks
- Table cloth and clips
- Collapsible wash bin (facility dependent)

# Food & Water

The beauty of car camping is that you can go heavy and are really unlimited compared to backcountry cooking. Need ideas for your meals? Check out some blogs such as [Fresh Off the Grid](https://www.freshoffthegrid.com/) or [Dirty Gourmet](https://www.dirtygourmet.com/) for great ideas on what to eat while car camping.

Remember to NEVER leave food, trash, or other smelly things (other than you!) in your tent, and to absolutely minimize leaving your food unattended. Food and coolers should be stored in your car, metal food lockers, or in a bear canister/hung from a bear pole while not being consumed and supervised.

It is always nice to have the following items with you in [mini nalgene containers](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/4005-479/Small-Travel-Kit):

- Salt & Pepper
- Spices Mixes
- Cooking Oil (Olive, Canola, Avocado)
- Honey

And don’t forget your:

- Snacks
- Meals
- Waterbottles/reservoirs (filled!)
- Water filter/purifier or treatment tools
- Extra food! It’s never a bad idea to bring an extra day’s worth of food.

# Safety & Tools

- Headlamp
- Extra batteries
