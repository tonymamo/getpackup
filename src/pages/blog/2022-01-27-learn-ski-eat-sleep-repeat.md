Earlier this winter Packup co-founder, [Taylor Burk](https://www.instagram.com/taylormichaelburk/) spent 5 days in the Callaghan backcountry based at the [Journeyman Lodge](https://www.callaghancountry.com/journeyman-lodge.html) for an AST-2 course and guided ski touring in the valley. Located just south of Whistler, this type of lodge is unique in BC; it’s uncommon to find upscale full-service lodging in the backcountry that you don't need a helicopter to access. To get there you have the options of cross country skiing, snowshoeing or touring through old growth forests. Alternatively you can save your energy and take a snowmobile up while your gear gets dropped off for you by the friendly staff. Once there, the lodge serves as your home base while you ski your heart out from dawn to dusk.

This trip was organized by [Mabey Ski](https://www.mabeyski.com/), a boutique travel agency that specializes in providing unique and adventurous ski trips around the world. Everyone in the group started off as strangers but friendships developed over multiple days of learning and skiing together and were celebrated over amazing food and bottles of wine in the evenings. I found that building connection and rapport with your group over multiple days in the field helps create realistic situations for backcountry trips; you really get to know everyone's strengths and weaknesses and can come up with solid plans as a team.

There was a flow and routine to each day which went a little bit like this; learn, ski, eat, sleep and repeat!

Let's break it down.

**<br></br>**

## **Learn.**

Each morning started off with a coffee in the lodge discussing our plans for the day and what we wanted to gain out of it. Once we went over the avalanche and weather forecast we picked which slopes looked best and set out into the mountains eager to absorb as much knowledge as we could. No one wants to end up in a situation where they have to dig someone out from an avalanche but it’s important to know exactly what to do if that were to occur, and to develop the skills needed to avoid those situations in the first place. Taking the next step in avalanche education via the AST-2 course is fun, engaging and takes you into the field for plenty of real world experience. We spent each day immersed in the backcountry, learning terrain choice, leadership skills, avalanche safety, backcountry travel and much more from our private ACMG qualified guide, Graham.

This was my second time doing my AST-2, this time as a refresher to sharpen my skills. It can be easy to forget certain procedures or feel overly confident after years of backcountry skiing. I'd recommend a refresher course if it’s been a few years since you last took it.

**<br></br>**

## **Ski.**

Location, location, location. There are 12,000 hectares of non-motorized alpine terrain at your doorstep. Typically this valley is a lot colder than the Whistler area and receives more snow as well as a longer season (average winter snowfall of 6.2 metres).

With the lodge located in the Callaghan Basin you have plenty of options of where to ski based upon the avalanche conditions and weather, everything from high alpine bowls and glacier skiing to glades, pillows and rolling powder hills. You’re only a short tour away from your objectives in the valley, allowing plenty of time for multiple laps without burning out your legs too badly beforehand.

We made the most of each day and found all the best pockets of snow thanks to our knowledgeable guide! The incredible views and good company made up for any bad snow conditions that we came across.

## **Eat.**

The lodge chef kept busy continuously cooking up hearty and delicious breakfasts, lunches and dinners to fuel our adventures. The three course dinners did much more than help us earn back all the calories that were burnt while out exploring the endless terrain each day. You definitely didn’t have to worry about going hungry on this trip, there was always fresh food available and endless tea and coffee. Each night over dinner and drinks we reflected on the day and all the fun that was had! It was always something to look forward to.

## **Sleep.**

The lodge is “rustic-luxe”, it has the warmth and charm of an alpine hut along with all of the amenities and fine dining of a high end lodge. Sleeping quarters are private but all the guests eat and relax together, giving everyone a chance to share the day’s adventures and connect with like-minded people.

There’s no excuse to be bored with all of the activities available at the lodge. In the evenings we spent our time in the games lounge playing pool, ping pong, chess and a variety of other activities that brought our group together to bond over some intense moments. Other's enjoyed reading, lounging and stretching the night away.

## **Repeat.**

Then comes the best part, time to do it all again the next day!

[Mabey Ski](https://www.mabeyski.com/adventures/) creates unique ski adventures across the globe that push boundaries and challenge the conventional. They ski all over the world to find those unmarked backcountry huts, mountainside hot springs, and connect with larger-than-life ski guides that become lifelong friends. Keep an eye out for future excursions where you can expand your skillset and ski some incredible backcountry terrain all in one trip!

A big part in reducing risk in the backcountry is being properly prepared for any scenario or situation. To prep for this trip I used Packup to ensure that nothing was left behind or forgotten. [Try it out](https://getpackup.com/signup) on your next trip and let us know what you think!
