Earlier this winter packup co-founder, Taylor Burk had spent 5 days in the Callaghan backcountry based at the Journeyman Lodge for an AST-2 course and guided ski touring in the valley. Located just south of Whistler, this lodge is pretty rare in the sense that it’s uncommon to find upscale lodging in the BC backcountry that isn't accessed by helicopter. To get there you have the options of cross country skiing, snowshoeing, touring or save your energy and take a snowmobile up through old growth forests while your gear gets dropped off for you by the friendly staff. Once there, the lodge serves as your home base while you ski your heart out from dawn to dusk.

This trip was put together and organized by [Mabey Ski](https://www.mabeyski.com/), a boutique travel agency that specializes in providing unique and adventurous ski trips around the world and locally, here in British Columbia. Everyone in the group started off as strangers but friendships developed over multiple days of learning and skiing together and were celebrated over good food and bottles of wine in the evenings. I found that building connection and rapport with your group over multiple days in the field helps create realistic situations for backcountry trips, you really get to know everyone's strengths and weaknesses and can come up with solid plans as a team. 

There was a flow and routine to each day which went a little bit like this; learn, ski, eat, sleep and repeat!

Let's break it down:

## **Learn.**

No one wants to end up in a situation where they have to dig someone out from an avalanche but it’s important to know exactly what to do if that were to occur as well as developing the skills to avoid those situations in the first place. Taking the next step in avalanche education via the AST-2 course is fun, engaging and takes you into the field for plenty of real world experience. We spent each day immersed in the backcountry, learning terrain choice, leadership skills, avalanche safety, backcountry travel and much more from our private ACMG qualified guide, Graham. This was my second time doing my AST-2, this time as a refresher to sharpen my skills. It can be easy to forget certain procedures or feel overly confident. I'd recommend a refresher course if it’s been a few years since you last took it.

## **Ski.**

Location, location, location. There are 12,000 hectares of non-motorized alpine terrain at your doorstep, typically this valley is a lot colder than the Whistler area and receives a lot more snow as well as a longer season (average winter snowfall of 6.2 metres (20 feet)). 

With the lodge being set in the Callaghan Basin you have plenty of options on where to ski based upon the avalanche conditions and weather, everything from high alpine bowls and glacier skiing to glades, pillows and rolling powder hills. You’re only a short tour away from your objectives in the valley, allowing for plenty of time for multiple laps without burning out your legs too badly beforehand.

The ski conditions were a bit tough during this trip but there wasn’t a simple complaint from the group. We made the most of each day and took on whatever came at us!

## **Eat**

The lodge chef kept busy continuously cooking up hearty and delicious breakfasts, lunches and dinners to fuel our adventures. The three course dinners helped us earn back all the calories that were burnt while out exploring the endless terrain each day. You definitely didn’t have to worry about going hungry on this trip. Each night over dinner and drinks we reflected on the day and all the fun that was had!

## **Sleep**

4 nights spent waking up in the mountains in what the lodge calls “rustic-luxe”, there's the warmth and charm of an alpine hut but all the amenties and fine dining of a high end lodge that makes you feel right at home. There’s no excuse to be bored with the plethora of activities available at the lodge, in the evenings we spent our time in the games lounge playing pool, ping pong, chess and other heated games that brought our group together to bond over some intense moments.

The lodge sleeps a total of 24 people (15 single beds) in eight private rooms.

## **Repeat**

Time to do it all over again the next day! Truly living the dream.
