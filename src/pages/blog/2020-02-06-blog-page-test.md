## Pre-Trip

- Have you booked your campsite (and saved/printed your registration?)
- Is your car in good driving shape? Oil and Tires are checked?
- Do you need a map to reach your camping area? Do you need to save the map offline?

## Key Campsite Items

- Tent
  -- Main tent
  -- Fly cover
  -- Tent poles
  -- Stakes (dirt? sand? snow?)
  -- Ground sheet
- Sleeping bags
- Sleeping pads
- Camping pillows
- Camping chairs
- Lighting (lanterns, headlamps)
- Firewood & axe
- Extra tarp & rope
- Hammer/mallet for stakes
- Multi-tool
- Duct-tape (mattress repair/misc use)

## Camp Kitchen

The requirements for your camp kitchen will vary depending on the facilities available in proximity to your camp. Be prepared to bring and/or treat water if clean water is not available in your area, and dispose of garbage and greywater waste appropriately following the principles of [LNT (Leave No Trace)](https://www.leavenotrace.ca/). Minimizing environmental impact and the attraction of wildlife is of utmost importance - many bears who learn to scavenge human camps end up being killed by animal control due to continued negative human interactions.

- Camping stove/grill
- Fuel (pack extra, and suitable to stove type)
- Waterproof matches/lighters
- Hand Sanitizer/Soap
- Cooking pots/pans
- Cooking utensils (spatula, large spoon, tongs, etc)
- Prep knife
- Cutting board
- Aluminum foil
- Hot dog roasting forks
- Plates/bowls
- Cups/mugs
- Utensils
- Paper towel
- Folding table (can be great for cooking on)
- Table cloth
- Water storage cube (filled!)
- Cooler & ice
- Wash bin (facility dependent)
- Biodegradable soap
- Sponge
- Trash bags

Ideas for what to cook at camp could form the basis for an entire book or webpage, but it is always good have the following items with you in [mini nalgene containers](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/4005-479/Small-Travel-Kit):

- Salt & Pepper
- Spices Mixes
- Cooking Oil (Olive, Canola, Avocado)
- Honey

Remember to NEVER leave food, trash, or other smelly things (other than you!) in your tent, and to absolutely minimize leaving your food unattended. Food and coolers should be stored in your car, metal food lockers, or in a bear canister/hung from a bear pole while not being consumed and supervised.
