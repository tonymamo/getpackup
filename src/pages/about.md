## Where did the idea for packup come from?

During a complex multi-day ski traverse of the Wapta Icefields, the idea for our app originally sparked. We wanted to [build a platform](/) that could help others refine their flow when it comes to packing and organization for outdoor excursions and other travel. Missing an important item can be embarrassing at best, and sometimes dangerous.

Our mission is to help you become more organized and prepared for your outdoor adventures, and to make planning your trips on excel obsolete. We appreciate you taking the time to[ learn more about our app](/), we can't wait to share his with you!
