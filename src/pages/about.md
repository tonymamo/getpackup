## Where did the idea for packup come from?

During a complex multi-day ski traverse on the Wapta Ice Field the idea for our app originally sparked. We wanted to build a platform that could help others refine their flow when it comes to packing and organization. 

Our mission is to help you become more organized and prepared for your outdoor adventures. We appreciate you taking the time to learn more about our app, we can't wait to share his with you!
