### Our Story

During a complex multi-day ski traverse along the Wapta Icefield, the idea for our app originally sparked. After a lengthy pre-trip planning and packing process for our group (four friends spread across four different cities), we were inspired to create a platform that could reduce friction in the packing process for future adventures. 

### Our Mission

To increase the safety and enjoyment of outdoor adventures by improving competency and preparedness.

### Our Vision

Our suite of trip preparation and packing tools, along with contributions from a community of passionate users aims to create an ecosystem where you can always be prepared for your outdoor excursions. Forgetting an important item can be embarrassing at best, or life threatening and dangerous depending on the circumstances. With packup, we will ensure that no item is left behind.

Tony is a senior software engineer, designer, and outdoors enthusiast. A self-taught developer, he started out freelancing and eventually landed at a Fortune 10 company. After realizing the corporate life wasn't for him, he has since worked at several startups, working remotely, where he really found his ideal work-life balance. He enjoys the flexibility of being able to work from anywhere, which enabled him to spend a year on the road in a Sprinter van with his wife and dog, exploring all over North America. He has since settled down in Michigan, but is always dreaming up new travel locations, and occasionally traveling out of a cargo trailer he converted into a camper.
